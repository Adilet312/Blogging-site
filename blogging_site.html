      <h4>Hardware Intrinsics in .NET Core</h4>
      <p>Several years ago, we decided that it was time to support SIMD code in .NET. We introduced the System.Numerics namespace with Vector2, Vector3, Vector4, Vector<T>, and related types. These types expose a general-purpose API for creating, accessing, and operating on them using hardware vector instructions (when available).</p>

      <p>Default implementations in interfaces
      With last week’s posts Announcing .NET Core 3.0 Preview 5 and Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1 Preview 3, the last major feature of C# 8.0 is now available in preview.
      A big impediment to software evolution has been the fact that you couldn’t add new members to a public interface.</p>

      <h4>An update to C# versions and C# tooling</h4>
      <p>Starting with Visual Studio 2019 Preview 4, we'll be adjusting how C# versions are treated in .NET tooling. Firstly, we're adding two new Language Version (LangVersion) values: LatestMajor and Preview. Rad the post to see how they stack up with the currently supported list of values.</p>

      <h4>About me</h4>
      <p>Epicodus's mission is to help people learn the skills they need to get great jobs. For us, “great jobs” means jobs in growing industries that pay well and provide rewarding work. Beyond the particular skills needed to get these jobs, we aim to help our students become confident self-teachers who can adapt to changing job markets, and great communicators who will work well in teams. We focus on serving people who, by birth or circumstance, don't have easy access to learning the skills they need to get these great jobs.</p>
